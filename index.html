    About Me
     </h2>

<p>
My name is Khalil Pannell, I am an 11th grader at Central High School. I like learning about cars, especially my favorite car which is a Charger. I also like making money and I always had a desire to find new ways to make money. My main idea growing up was the thought of spending money in stores, so I made a decision to be the person on the other side actually making the money instead of spending it all the time.

I have a mindset for so many different career pathways Modeling,App Development,Carpentry and so much more so no matter what I decide to do in life I'll be successful because i have the skill for it. I could use all my skills and put my career pathways together.
